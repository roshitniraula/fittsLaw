# FittsLaw

# Overview

This project implements an experimental testing suite designed to evaluate Fitts’ Law, which predicts the time required for users to move a pointer to a target. The system measures pointing performance under varying combinations of target size, target distance, and direction, using either a mouse or a trackpad.

Participants complete multiple pointing tasks where they must click on randomly generated circles as quickly and accurately as possible. The collected data is later analyzed using linear regression to study the relationship between Index of Difficulty (ID) and movement time.
